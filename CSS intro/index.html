        <p>This is a paragraph...
            Due to the "body" element having purple
            stlye in the CSS file all the text is defaulted
            to purple...
            but for the class selectors, since they have 
            higher heirarchy than the element selectors in CSS, 
            they have the special colors that are specified
            in the CSS file...
